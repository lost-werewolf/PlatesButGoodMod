The mod you never knew you needed as a builder...
Plates. But good.

This mod allows placing of any item onto plates.
They appear at full size, and can be flipped if the plate is placed the opposite direction.
Being able to place full item sprites opens up a huge avenue for decoration that was untapped.
You can place mini furniture, or misaligned crates, for example.

This mod is labeled as client side.
You can use this in multiplayer without everyone or the server requiring the mod.
Other players will be able to see items you place on plates, but animated items will be broken.
