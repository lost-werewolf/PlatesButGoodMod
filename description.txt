The mod you never knew you needed as a builder...
Plates. But good.

This mod allows placing of any item onto plates.
They appear at full size and can appear flipped if the plate is placed the opposite direction.

Items that have animated textures are unsupported and will look funny.
This is not a mod issue - this is an issue with how the vanilla game renders these items.

This mod is labeled as client side.
You can use this in multiplayer without everyone requiring the mod, and they will see any items you place onto plates.
